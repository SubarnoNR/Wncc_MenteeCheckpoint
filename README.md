CNN and its Applications

So far, we have learnt quite a few things about Machine Learning and also python and its various libraries required for machine learning.

Machine Learning:  
We have been following the Stanford University course on Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera. The first few weeks of the course focussed on the introductory part, difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, linear regression in one and multiple variables, gradient descent, linear algebra, logistic regression, and introduction to neural networks.

Python:  
We have been given 4 assignments so far based on what we have learnt. The first assignment was on general python as well as image processing, for which we learnt about a few functions from the numpy, opencv and matplotlib libraries. The second assignment was on linear regression. We learnt to analyse data, how to work with csv files with pandas and also to apply the linear regression algorithm. At the end, we also implemented linear regression on the data using sklearn library. The third assignment was on logistic regression.
